# About:
An example folder structure for your datasets. The csv files are used to specify which images in "Source1" and "Source2" are used for training, 
validation and testing. You can specify "issues" of the images to filter out images which you do not want to use, but want to list for completeness. Images with issues are not used during the training process. Please note that the "img_path" is appended to "dataset_lowest_folder" to locate the images, which you can specify in the config files.
